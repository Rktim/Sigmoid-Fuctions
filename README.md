# Sigmoid Function Plotter

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to plot the sigmoid function in both Python and R. The sigmoid function is widely used in machine learning, especially in logistic regression and neural networks, due to its properties of mapping input values to a range between 0 and 1.

## Introduction

The sigmoid function is defined as:

\[
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\]

This project provides scripts to plot the sigmoid function using Python and R. These plots can be useful for visualizing the behavior of the sigmoid function across a range of input values.

## Dependencies

### Python

- `numpy` (for numerical computations)
- `matplotlib` (for plotting)

### R

- 'plot',`ggplot2` (optional, for advanced plotting)
- Base R functions for plotting are also used.
